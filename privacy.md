# Privacy Policy
Your data always belongs to you, and only you. CidiaWebsiteDump does not collect any data.

## How your data is protected and used
- By default, CidiaWebsiteDump does not send any data to our servers or any third parties. All your data is processed and stored locally on your device. 
- If you connect CidiaWebsiteDump to your Google Drive account, data is only transmitted from your browser to servers belonging to Google. 
- If you save pages on GitHub, data is only transmitted from your browser to servers belonging to GitHub. 
- If you enable the "synchronize options" setting, your options will be sent to servers belonging to the vendor of the browser you are using. 
- If you enable the "add proof of existence" setting, a SHA256 hash of each saved page will be sent to servers belonging to Woleet. 
- When processing a page, CidiaWebsiteDump needs to inject temporary data into the page to save it accurately. CidiaWebsiteDump can download resources that are not displayed or not already cached but present in the page. When using CidiaWebsiteDump in Chromium-based browsers, websites can fetch resources declared in the "web_accessible_resources" section of the manifest.json file. Because of this, a website may be able to detect you are using CidiaWebsiteDump or have saved a page on the website with CidiaWebsiteDump.
